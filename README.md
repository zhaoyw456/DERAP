The goal of precision oncology is to select more effective treatments or beneficial drugs for patients. The transcriptome of ‘‘hidden responders’’ which precision oncology often fails to identify for patients is important for revealing responsive molecular states. Recently, a RAS pathway activation detection method based on machine learning and a nature-inspired deep RAS activation pan-cancer has been proposed. However, we note that the activating gene variations found in KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS vary substantially across cancers. Besides, the ability of a machine learning classifier to detect which KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS gain of function mutations or copy number gains cause the Ras pathway activation not clear. Here, we proposed a deep neural network framework for deciphering and identifying pan-cancer RAS pathway activation (DIPRAS). DIPRAS brings a new insight into deciphering and identifying the Pan-cancer RAS Pathway Activation from a deeper perspective. In addition, we further revealed the identification and characterization of RAS aberrant pathway activity through gene ontological enrichment and pathological analysis.
